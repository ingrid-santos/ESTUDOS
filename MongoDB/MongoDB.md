# [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

- NoSQL Database
- Written in C++
- Document Oriented
- Works on concept of collection and document
  - collection is a group of MongoDB documents (equivalent of an RDBMS table). Do not enforce schema.
  - a document is a set of key-value pairs. Documents have dynamic schema. Dynamic schema means that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data.
- Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents
